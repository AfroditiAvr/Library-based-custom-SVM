# Library-based-custom-SVM
This project was developed as part of the Neural Networks course at the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It evolves a custom Support Vector Machine implementation using cvxopt libray for binary classification, a library-based SVM for hyperparameter tuning and multiclass classification of cifar-10 dataset. It concludes with a comparison between the implemented SVM and an MLP. For more information, please refer to the report (in Greek).
